In this screen,

- `Delete Chatroom` button deletes the messages of this chatroom permanently. Messages might still be visible to other users when connected to the room while deleting, they will not be visible after you disconnect from room. This is because they are stored locally in the `viewmodel` of their device. They are cleared after they disconnect.
